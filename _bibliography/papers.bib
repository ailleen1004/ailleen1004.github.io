abstract = {
The development of autonomous driving technology has led to its expanded application in public transportation, such as buses. For autonomous buses to operate without drivers, the tasks currently performed by drivers, including passenger management, must also be automated. Among these tasks, technology to determine whether passengers have completed boarding is essential for public transportation, which frequently stops and departs from stations. This paper studies the technology needed to recognize boarding passengers in autonomous buses and determine completion of boarding. By utilizing CCTV cameras installed in buses and deep learning-based vision technology, we recognize boarding passengers and use this information to determine boarding completion. We propose algorithms based on region, clustering, and body orientation for passenger recognition, and use field tests to compare performance of each algorithm in recognizing passengers.
