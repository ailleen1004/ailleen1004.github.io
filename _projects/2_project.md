This paper proposes a service through a braille translator application that allows capturing braille in real-life scenarios, recognizing the braille within the mage, and providing translation. By expanding the translation scope to include not only individual alphabet images but also word and sentence-level braille images added to the dataset, the translation range is extended up to sentences. To achieve fast and accurate braille recognition, the real-time object detection model YOLOv7 is utilized. To correct errors that may occur during the braille recognition process, the natural language processing model GPT-3 is employed. The ultimate goal is to enhance the accessibility of braille, promote convenience for visually impaired individuals, and facilitate the universal adoption of braille.
