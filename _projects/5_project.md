I support to develop a smart block that can be installed on the floor between gates to implement a contactless payment system. The smart block is equipped with a pressure sensor, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LED (Light Emitting Diode) modules. It recognizes user locations using a pressure sensor, matches smartphone to user through BLE communication, performs payment, and displays payment status through LED. In addition to smart blocks, we develop payment servers, MQ (Message Queue) brokers, and smartphone applications and performed non-contact payments by linking these with smart blocks. Through field experiments, we verified that the non-contact payment system can operate smoothly even in situations in which congestion around gate is high.
