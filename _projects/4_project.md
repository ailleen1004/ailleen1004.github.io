This study aims to perform 3D modeling of railway infrastructure (tunnels, bridges, catenary, utility poles, rails) using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and improved modeling techniques based on it (e.g., 'Instant NGP', 'F2-NeRF', '3D Gaussian Splatting'). The modeling results are quantitatively evaluated (R/E, PSNR, SSIM) to derive the optimal modeling method.
